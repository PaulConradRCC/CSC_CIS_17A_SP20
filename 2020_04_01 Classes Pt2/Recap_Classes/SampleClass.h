/*
 *  10. Key point #1 - why use the private access specifier for member variables?
 *	a. Making data members private provides data protection.
 *	b. These data members can be accessed only through public functions of the class.
 *	c. Public functions define the classâ€™s public interface.
 *  11. Key point #2 - separate specification from implementation:
 *	a. Q: Why do this? A: Intellectual property protection (anyone outside your 	
 *          organization does not see the interworkings of the class - they can have the binary 	
 *          machine code library for their programs and your intellectual property is still 	
 *          protected), flexibility (different architectures or platforms may have slightly different 	
 *          implementation requirements), and easier maintenance.
