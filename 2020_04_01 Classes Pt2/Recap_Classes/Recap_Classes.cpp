 * Classes and Object Oriented Programming
 *  1. Procedural programming focuses on the process/actions that occur in a program.  
 *      This is what you have learned so far in your journey of learning C++.
 *  2. Object-Oriented Programming, also known as OOP.  
 *  3. Object Oriented Programming is based on the data and the functions that operate on it.  
 *      Objects are instances of ADTs (abstract data types) that represent the data and its functions.
 *  4. Some issues with Procedural Programming:
 *	a. If the data structures change, many functions must also be changed
 *	b. Programs that are based on complex function hierarchies:
 *		1. can be difficult to understand and maintain
 *		2. can be difficult to modify and extend
 *		3. can be easy to break if these complexities are not completely understood
 *
 * 5. Object Oriented Programming terminologies:
 *	a. class: similar to a struct (allows bundling of related member variables or fields),
 *          but variables and functions in the class can have different properties than in a struct
 *	b. A class is like a blueprint and objects are like houses built from the blueprint.
 *	c. object: an instance of a class, in the same way that a variable can be an instance of a struct.
 *	d. attributes: member variables of a class 
 *	e. methods or behaviors: member functions of a class that perform actions
 *	f. often we will have what are called accessor and mutator functions.
 *		1. accessors are member functions that do read access to our member variables
 *		2. mutators are member functions that do write access to our member variables 
 *                  (good programming practice tip: do your class's input validation here).
